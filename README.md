# atlasLanguage
A lexer, parser and interpretor made using C.

This is a simple expression evaluator which can perform binary operations by taking in string expressions.

This is made as a project in DS to understand the C language better and to understand the concepts behind a compiler or an interpretor.

The lexer tokenises the expression, returns the tokens which gets passed to the parser which then converts it into a postfix exression, which can be evaluated using the expression evaluator.
